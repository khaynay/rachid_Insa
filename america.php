						<h2><span>Why America?</span></h2>
						<h5><b>Pros</b></h5>
						<p>-The world’s leading study destination for international students.</p>
						<p>-A global leader in technology, media, business and economic development.</p>
						<p>-Most Top American universities are household names all around the world both in academic circles and through the reputation of their alumni.</p>
						<p>-Universitas 21 survey named the US Higher Education system to be the best in the world, based on investment by the government, research, international ties and production of an educated workforce</p>
						<p>-Many American cities are key international hubs in most professional fields, including media and communications, business, finance, economics and research. </p>
						<p>-The US is known as a global economic superpower</p>
						<br>
												<h5><b>Cons</b></h5>
						<p>- International Student Tuition is very expensive; and is increasing at a rapid rate (especially in private universities).</p>
						<p>- Living expenses are slowly rising every year.</p>
						<p>- Hundreds of thousands of international students applies to U.S. universities every year, so you may not get accepted into your favorite school.</p>
						<p>- Outside of the Computer Science/Programming/Information technology, it is difficult for international students to obtain work sponsorship.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="image-caption-box">
						<div class="text-box">
							<h2>System of Education</h2>
							<p>- Also called ‘junior colleges,’ community colleges offer two-year programs called Associate Degrees that may be used as a bridging qualification to a four-year Bachelor degree.</p>
							<p>- Costs of studying at a community college also average to be less than half of those at a public university, and about one-tenth of those at a private university.</p>
							<p>- Public institutions are state universities that are funded by that state’s government, and offer studies in most general areas. Tuition fees are lower for students from that state. Private universities are often pricier, more selective and offer more specialist subjects or facilities. </p>
							<p>- Bachelors degrees in America follow a general education model, meaning that students will complete a study in a general field within which they will specialize in a particular area that is called their ‘major.’</p>
							<p>- Completing a degree program can take as long to complete as it takes a student to meet all the credit requirements.</p>
							<p>- International students must take at least 12 credits per semester to maintain their visa status. Most undergraduate programs are designed for completion across four years for full-time students.</p>
							<p>- Masters degrees generally require completion of six-eight advanced courses, as well as an intensive study project and/or a thesis.</p>

							<h2>How to Apply to an American University</h2>
							<p>- To start your application to study in the US, you will need to apply directly to each of the universities you’re interested in.</p>
							<p>- Entry requirements for each university are different, but most involve completing an admissions test or essay, the SAT or ACT admissions tests, and providing recommendation letters from teachers. On top of this, most universities ask for a transcript of your grades and a personal statement.</p>
							<p>- Undergraduate application deadlines for a start in semester one of the American academic year (September) are from January-March of the same year, with most generally falling in January.</p>
							<p>- Students needing to provide admissions and English language proficiency test scores as part of their applications will need to have them handy in time for this date.</p>
							<p>- There is also a centralized application process called the <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/" target="new">Common Application</a> that is used by over 700 American universities. Almost two thirds of universities using the service however require that applicants submit additional documents directly to them. </p>

							<h2>Visa</h2>
							<p>- Most international students will require an F-1 visa. This visa is for international students who have been accepted into a full-time academic degree program at an accredited US College or University</p>
						
							<p>- The US visa requirements process below:</p>
							<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Pay the Machine Readable Visa (MRV) application fee of US$160 (the embassy will tell you where you should pay this).</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Complete a DS-160 form online, uploading a photograph.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Bring to the interview your acceptance letter; proof you’ve paid the required fees and completed the relevant forms; the Form I-20 or Form DS-2019 to demonstrate your eligibility; and a passport which doesn’t expire until at least six months after you complete your degree, unless you’re exempt due to country-specific agreements.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	The decision to issue a visa is in the hands of the consular officer. Their decision will hinge on three things: whether you can financially support yourself, whether you can show you can and want to return home after graduating (getting a work visa is a whole different process), and whether you can prove your academic results to date.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	The last of these may involve proving your proficiency in English. You will also have to provide evidence of this to your university at the application stage.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Additional documents may be requested to establish your academic preparation, your intent to depart the US upon completion of your course of study, and how you will cover your costs. Make sure you have these with you when you go to the visa application interview.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Additional demands will be made if you have a criminal record, and being granted a visa doesn’t guarantee entry into the US.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	Your local US embassy should be able to tell you the expected wait time for your visa. You can receive your US study visa a maximum of 120 days before your course’s start date, but processing can commence before this date.</li>
							<li class="list-group-item">•	You cannot actually enter the country until 30 days before the beginning of your course, unless you have a visitor visa. This last stipulation also applies to those who would normally not require a visa for short stays in the US.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Cost of living and scholarhships</h2>
							<p>- International student tuition at undergraduate level is calculated to be between US$ 16,320-US$ 34,656 per year.</p>
							<p>- Average tuition costs at a community college are calculated at around US$ 2,527 per year.</p>
							<p>- The average cost for a master’s degree at a public university was calculated to be US$28,375 per year, and US$ 38,665 per year at a private university. The expected range of tuition fees for an entire master’s program ranges roughly between US$ 23,520- US$ 79,317.</p>
							<p>- A PhD program was shown to cost an average of US$ 32,966 at a public institution, and US$ 46,029 at a private one.</p>
							<p>- Costs for food and living are normally between $8,000 and $12,000 dollars per year.</p>
							<p>- The Fulbright program is a US government-sponsored organization that helps non-US students finance their studies at US institutions. Learn more about the Fulbright Scholarship Program</p>
							<p>- Most American universities offer some kind of funding for international students.</p>
							<p>- Scholarships are typically awarded based on academic merit or financial needs, but in some cases may be tied to specific study areas or work in partnership with external institutions.</p>
							<p>- You can search for a scholarship using an external search engine such as <a href="http://www.internationalscholarships.com/" target="new">International Scholarships</a>, <a href="http://www.internationalstudent.com/scholarships/International" target="new"> Student or International Scholarship Search.</a></p>
