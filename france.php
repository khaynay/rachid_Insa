						<h2><span>Why France?</span></h2>
						<h5><b>Pros</b></h5>
						<p>-The French are passionate about higher education and invest heavily in research, meaning its universities consistently perform well in global university rankings</p>
						<p>-Perfect opportunity to sharpen up your French language skills.</p>
						<p>-The cost of higher education in France is quite reasonable compared to other popular study destinations such as the UK and the USA. </p>
						<p>-Funding and grants are also available and the French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs allocates a large number of grants to international students.</p>
						<p>-it's important to note that the cost of living can be considerably higher, particularly in cities like Paris where food and accommodation can be pricey. </p>
						<p>-The higher education system is underpinned by strong government support and research departments and business schools are some of the best in the world.</p>
						<p>-French and international students pay the same tuition fees</p>
						<br>
												<h5><b>Cons</b></h5>
						<p>- Educational culture-shock: Things are not going to be like they were in your country with respect to lectures/seminars. At the start of a course, you can be as many as 500–700 in lecture halls. Finding spaces to sit can become a bit of a lottery. The exams take on a special form of importance, as they are the primary means of cutting down the class sizes.</p>
						<p>-Language</p>

					<div class="image-caption-box">
						<div class="text-box">
							<h2>System of Education and Post-Study</h2>
							<p>-A Bachelor degree, known as ‘Licence’ lasts 3-4 years</p>
							<p>-Master’s degree usually last 2 years</p>
							<p><b>Public Universities</b> (The French government funds public universities and it also oversees all regulation of the national diploma granted by these universities. Public universities offer an affordable but high quality education and are popular among international students.)</p>
							<p><b>Private Universities</b> (tuition fees at private institutions are predictably much more expensive than at government-funded public universities. However, these specialized institutions often offer the best teaching and training within their fields.) </p>
							<p><b>Grande école</b> (Grandes Écoles are high quality higher education institutions that run alongside the public and private university system in France. They have a competitive outlook and admission into these schools is often more challenging.)</p>
						</div>

					<div class="image-caption-box">
						<div class="text-box">
							<h2>How to Apply to a French University</h2>
							<p>-In general the documents required are: a valid passport that will be valid during your stay in France, Transcripts from previous institutions, certifying your level of education, A passing grade in a French language exam, if your program requires it</p>

							<p> -For those that do not live in one of these countries, you will have to file a DAP directly with the French embassy or consulate in your country. </p>
							<p> -For those that do not live in one of these countries, you will have to file a DAP directly with the French embassy or consulate in your country. </p>

							<h2>Visa</h2>
							<p>-Once accepted by a French institution, you’ll need to apply for a visa, which also includes a residence permit, called the VLS-TS, this option will cover your entire stay of your studies (three-four years).</p>
							<p>-If the universities you are applying to in France require you to sit an entrance exam in order to gain admission, you can apply for a “visa de court séjour étudiant concours”. If you are successful in your entrance exam, you’ll be able to apply for a one-year residence permit.</p>
							<p>-The Documents you will need are the following:</p>
							<ul class="list-group">
							<li class="list-group-item">An acceptance letter onto an accredited program of study at a French institution </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Proof of funds. This includes covering living costs and can be proven with a bank statement, letter from a guarantor or document stating your funding, grant or scholarship details. </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Proof of return ticket home. If you don’t have your ticket home yet you can also submit a handwritten statement of intent detailing planned departure dates. </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Proof of medical insurance (minimum insurance €30,000) </li>
							<li class="list-group-item">Proof of accommodation. This could be any official confirmation from your landlord in France or a certificate detailing your student residence arrangement. </li>

							</ul>
							<p>-You will need to provide documentation to show that you can fund your studies as well as having the funds to support yourself while living in Canada through bank statements, proof of payment of accommodation or tuition fees, and scholarship or bursary notifications.</p>

							<h2>Cost of living and scholarhships</h2>
							<p>-The average cost of housing in France is €250-700 per month, although this rate is greatly affected by the region that you stay in, with major cities like Paris being the most expensive.</p>
							<p>-If your university or grandes écoles offers the option of a university residence, in most instances you’ll able to set this all up before you arrive by contacting your institution or international officer. The average cost of a university is between €250 and €350 per month.</p>
							<p>-On average the of living of a student in France is 8000 euros.</p>
							<p>-Several Scholarships are available for international students that will greatly help them in covering their tuition fees. Among them we find:</p>

The tuition grant is up to 7300 euros per year.</p>
							<p><b>The Eiffel Excellence Scholarship:</b> The Eiffel Excellence Scholarship Program was established by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development to enable French higher education establishments to attract top foreign students to enroll in their master’s and PhD courses.</p>
							<p><b>Erasmus Mundus Scholarships for International Students:</b> Funded by the European Union, the Erasmus Mundus Scholarships for International Students are available to both EU and non-EU students that have been selected to attend one of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Programs at Masters or Doctorate level.</p>
