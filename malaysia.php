							<h2>System of Education and Post-Study</h2>
							<p>- Bachelor degrees in Malaysia are typically between 3-5 years in length for full time students.</p>
							<p>- Some universities offer students the chance to gain an Honours (Hons) qualification as part of their Bachelors. Entry criteria are unique to each program, but will always require a high academic standard and typically add a year onto the student’s Bachelor degree.</p>
							<p>- Honours students will often need to complete a long-form research task in their final year such as a thesis or independent research project. Students need to apply separately for an Honours program, and should research separate application dates and deadlines thoroughly. </p>
							<p>- Most programs at private universities are taught in English, whilst Bachelor programs at public institutions are primarily taught in the Malay or Bahasa Melayu languages.</p>
							<p> - Malaysian Masters programs can take between 1-5 years to complete for full time students, depending on particular credit requirements. PhDs may take up to four years.</p>
							<p>- Dates in the Malaysian academic year vary from institution to institution.</p>
							<p>-A student’s ‘major’ is a specific area they have chosen to focus on within their general field of study. Students must complete a certain quota of subjects in this area in order to be gain the title</p>
							<p>-A ‘minor’ is a secondary area of focus within a general study field with a lower requirement quota.</p>
							<p>-Malaysian universities offer students the unique opportunity to complete their Bachelor’s degree across two partnering institutions in different countries. In the ‘2+1’ twinning program, students may choose to gain course credit from a reputable university in countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France or Germany</p>
							<p>-Students also have the option to complete a ‘3+0’ foreign Bachelors program, in which foreign study programs are conducted by institutions in Malaysia.</p>
							<p>-Students pay Malaysian tuition fees throughout their entire undergraduate program, regardless of host country or nature of twinning program.</p>

The rentals are to be paid monthly and other utilities such as water, electricity; gas and cable TV are to be paid by the students themselves according to the monthly usage.</p>
							<p>-The cost of off campus accommodation per student can be anywhere from RM 150.00 to RM 3000.00 a month depending the area of living, type, furniture, facilities and number of students sharing.</p>
							<p>-You can expect a bedroom in an off-campus shared flat to be around RM350-RM500 per month, and an off-campus studio flat to cost about RM1500-RM2500 per month.</p>
							<p>-The cost of living for international students in Malaysia is as low as RM 10,000-12,000 (~US$2,370-2,840) per year, including food, travel and accommodation.</p>
